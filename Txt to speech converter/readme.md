# AWS Lambda + S3 + Polly Text-to-Speech

This project converts text files stored in Amazon S3 into audio files using Amazon Polly.  
No Comprehend is used — only Lambda, S3, and Polly.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

We use two S3 folders (prefixes):

- **`input/`** — Place `.txt` files here for processing.
- **`audio/`** — Generated `.mp3` files are saved here.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Upload a `.txt` file to the `input/` folder in S3.
2. An **S3 event trigger** invokes an AWS Lambda function.
3. Lambda:
   - Reads the text from the file.
   - Sends the text to **Amazon Polly**.
   - Receives the audio output (MP3 format).
   - Saves the MP3 file to the `audio/` folder in the same S3 bucket.
4. The audio file can then be downloaded or streamed.

## 🛠️ Setup Steps

### 1. Create an S3 Bucket
- Create a new bucket (e.g., `my-tts-bucket`).
- Inside the bucket, create two folders:  
  - `input/`  
  - `audio/`

### 2. Create the Lambda Function
- Runtime: **Python 3.x** (or Node.js if preferred).
- Attach the following IAM permissions:
  - `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` (read input files)
  - `AmazonS3FullAccess` (to write audio files — or restrict to `audio/` prefix)
  - `AmazonPollyFullAccess` (to synthesize speech)
- Add an **S3 trigger** for the `input/` folder (`.txt` files only).

### 3. Paste Lambda Code 
📷 Example Workflow
	1.	Upload: input/example.txt
	2.	Lambda → Polly → Save
	3.	Output: audio/example.mp3 in S3
